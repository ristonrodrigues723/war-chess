This project brings a unique twist to the classic game of chess by introducing a 3D war-themed board and pieces. Inspired by popular PC war chess games from the past, this interactive experience allows players to command modern military units like tanks, artillery, and planes. The game features a visually stunning 3D chessboard where players can strategically move their pieces, while an AI opponent challenges them with its own tactical moves.

Features:

3D Chessboard: A visually engaging chessboard rendered in WebGL with smooth animations for placing and capturing pieces.
AI Opponent: Play against a basic AI that makes random valid moves, offering a challenging experience for beginners.
Interactive Controls: Select pieces using mouse clicks and visualize possible moves with highlighted squares.
Move History: Track the game progress with on-screen messages displaying the moved piece and its origin and destination squares.
Randomized Quotes: Each game starts with a fresh inspirational quote displayed on the board.
Player Images: Random player and AI profile pictures add personality to the game.
Zoom Functionality: Control the camera zoom level to get a closer look at the board or a wider view.
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository: Download the project files or clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the HTML File: Open the index.html file in a web browser that supports WebGL (most modern browsers).
Start Playing: The chessboard will load automatically. Begin by clicking a white piece to initiate your move.
Customization (Optional):

AI Difficulty: Currently, the AI makes random valid moves. This codebase could be expanded to implement more complex AI algorithms for a greater challenge.
